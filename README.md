Souther Water Corp. is a desalination company that sells fresh water for three customer segments: Residential, Public, and Private. Since the demand for agricultural and residential use is rising, Southern Water Corp. needed to maximize the availability of its three desalination plants. This has resulted in increased revenue for the calendar year. While the increase in revenue is fantastic, Southern Water Corp does not want an unsustainable rise in costs.

In this project, I used Excel to analyze the revenues, operational expenses and EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes) to be able to tell how the company is performing.
